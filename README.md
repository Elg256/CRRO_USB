# CRRO_USB
Application for symmetric encryption of files on a USB drive.

You can directly drag and drop files, and the program encrypt or decrypt it with the password previously enter.
Only the "encrypted_data" folder is use for storing encrypted data, all others folders of the usb stick can be use as normal.

The encryption and decryption use the 'cryptography' library using 'Fernet' (AES-128).
